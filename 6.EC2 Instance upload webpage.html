# ‚úÖ Step 1: Sign in to AWS Management Console
# Go to https://aws.amazon.com and log into your AWS account.

# ‚úÖ Step 2: Launch an EC2 Instance

# 1. Open EC2 Dashboard using the search bar at the top ‚Üí type "EC2" ‚Üí click "EC2".

# 2. Click ‚ÄúLaunch Instance‚Äù to create a new virtual machine.

# 3. Name your instance (e.g., MyWebServer) ‚Äî this is just for you to identify it.

# 4. Choose Amazon Machine Image (AMI):
#    - Select: Amazon Linux 2023 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type ‚Äî it's lightweight and supported.

# 5. Choose Instance Type:
#    - Select t2.micro ‚Äî this is eligible under AWS Free Tier (for free usage limits).

# 6. Create a Key Pair:
#    - Name it something like `web-key`.
#    - Download the `.pem` file ‚Äî it's your private key for SSH login. Keep it safe!

# 7. Configure Network:
#    - Allow HTTP (port 80) so your website is publicly accessible.
#    - Allow SSH (port 22) so you can log in to your instance.
#    - Choose "Anywhere" (0.0.0.0/0) ‚Äî okay for practice; not ideal for production.

# 8. Storage:
#    - Leave as default (8 GiB is plenty for a basic website).

# 9. Click ‚ÄúLaunch Instance‚Äù to create your server.

# Wait for the instance to fully start, then click ‚ÄúView Instances‚Äù to see it.

# ‚úÖ Step 3 (Windows): Connect to EC2 via SSH

# üõ† Option 1: Using Windows PowerShell

# Open PowerShell

# Navigate to the folder where your `.pem` file is downloaded
cd "C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads"

# SSH into your EC2 instance
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-public-ip
# (ec2-user is the default login user for Amazon Linux)

# ‚úÖ Step 4: Set Up Your Web Server (NGINX)

# Update your EC2 system's installed packages
sudo yum update -y

# Install NGINX (a popular, fast web server)
sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1 -y

# Start the NGINX service
sudo systemctl start nginx

# Make sure it starts automatically every time the server reboots
sudo systemctl enable nginx

# ‚úÖ Step 5: Deploy Your HTML Site

# Go to the directory where NGINX serves your website files
cd /usr/share/nginx/html

# Remove the default NGINX landing page (index.html)
sudo rm index.html

# Install Git so you can clone your GitHub repo
sudo yum install git -y

# Clone your GitHub repository to the EC2 server
sudo git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

# Copy your main HTML file into the NGINX root directory
sudo cp your-repo/index.html .

# (Optional) If you have a CSS file, copy that too
sudo cp your-repo/style.css /usr/share/nginx/html

# Restart NGINX to apply the changes
sudo systemctl restart nginx

# ‚úÖ Step 6: View Your Website

# Now visit your EC2 public IP in a browser:
# ‚Üí http://your-ec2-public-ip

# You should see your website live!
